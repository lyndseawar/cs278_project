# cs278_project
design, launch, and manage a social computing system


In the course project, you will work in a group of three to four to design, launch, and manage a social computing system. It is not a project that you can cram: it takes time, effort, and patience to create a thriving social computing system. This is your chance to put all of the lessons from the quarter together, and have a positive influence on the world.
